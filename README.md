# franz8.github.io
Personal github for blob posts about technology and business processes. Code posted will 
be open source without restrictions that you can do anything but I am not responsible 
for anything that happens if you run the code. In general, I will test my code but everybody
has different systems and settings so Caveat Utilitor (Latin for User Beware). Hopefully, 
I will help some along as they learn from my mistakes. Cheers. 
Franz
